Modify the `myinfo.csv` file in such a way that satisfies the following
conditions:
1. The very first line should have the exact string (no extra space chars
   allows):

    ```
    student_id,email,github_id
    ```

2. The next (2nd) line should contain a comma-separated values for your student
   ID, email address, and GitHub ID. For example, suppose your student ID, email
   address, and GitHub ID are "20001234", "myemail@kaist.ac.kr", and "awesomeid",
   respectively. Then the 2nd line of the `myinfo.csv` file should be:

    ```
    20001234,myemail@kaist.ac.kr,awesomeid
    ```

3. In conclusion, the `myinfo.csv` file should have two lines in total, and it
   should look as below:

    ```
    student_id,email,github_id
    20001234,myemail@kaist.ac.kr,awesomeid
    ```
